# USA PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
### Introduction 
This project is based on predicting a candidate likely to win an election in the United States. It shows the following files: the dataset file, summary of the dataset, the pipeline model,image folder and the model data. In order to carry out analysis with this project, a pipeline model analysis was carried out alongside a regression anlysis. This analysis reveals a likely candidate and its respective party in an election.

### The Data Folder

Datasets include election results on city, district, county, state and national level from 1976-2016.

### Key Points
The Project baseline is centered on two datasets. In PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION BY COUNTY, a regression model was built to predict the likelihood of a party winning an election which is limited only to the dominant parties. The REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT party in the year 2016 Election.
 The Second dataset is the total observation of Presidential Election over a period of 40years.And we aimed to build a classification model that profiles a candidate chances of winning an Election. 

### Summary of the Dataset

  1.   ##### This folder 📁 
provides an analysis of how the various data in the dataset folder were merged together. It provides a summary of each respective data in the folder before it was merged

  2.   ##### The Pipeline 📁 
 This includes various files and folders used to create a pipeline using the data obtained. Deployed model, preprocess data, the training and testing model obtained and the pipeline analysis is shown here.

  3.  ##### The model 📁 
 This illustrates a regression model analysis of the dataset. The presidential election data was used to carry out this anlysis due to time constraint on testing the remaining dataset.

  4.  ##### The Images 📁 
This shows various visuals used in pipeline model, regression model anlysis and other images needed to report the anlysis of this data.
